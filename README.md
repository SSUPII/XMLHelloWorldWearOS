This is a port of the Jetpack Compose Hello World example (Empty Wear App in Android Studio) to XML layouts, yet keeping it in Kotlin.

The purpose of this repository is to have a template available for new applications to be made using XML layouts without having to setup the environment anew, as the current default for new applications is to use Jetpack Compose.
